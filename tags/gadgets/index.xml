      <description>Four weeks ago I stumbled upon the mechanical keyboards from Keychron on social media. Since I was thinking about switching my current setup consisting of a Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, a regular Logitech mouse and Keyboard connected to my MacBook Pro and Linux box respectively, to a setup supporting multiple devices at once.
I defined for me the following requirements for a keyboard:
 Wireless/Bluetooth (sick of having cables all over the place) Build in battery (replacing batteries every 2 weeks is a pain and an environmental disaster) Multi device support (ideally 3 or more) Mechanical keys (for the better touch) Compact (&amp;lt; 100%) layout (no need for numpad) Retro look (:-))  From browsing keyboards from various vendors my choice fell on the Keychron K6 mechanical with brown Gateron switches with white background lighting.</description>
